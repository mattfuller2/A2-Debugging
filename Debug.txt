 For each bug you are tracking down: 
 	1. Name the failed test where you are beginning your hunt
 	2. Where you placed breakpoints
 	3. Where the bug was found
 	4. What you did to fix it
 	5. How you recognized the bug
 	
 Bug #1:
 	1. emptySet_testIsEmpty
 	2. SetTester Line 101: Calls testIsEmpty() method
 	3. The bug was found in the isEmpty() method in ArraySet
 	4. I changed the return statement from 
 			"return (rear > 0);" to 
 			"return (rear == 0);" 
		so it would return "true" if the set is empty and "false" if it is not empty.
	5. I recognized the bug when the result variable in the SetTester.testIsEmpty() method 
		was set to false and the expected result was supposed to be true.
		
 Bug #2:
 	1. emptySet_addA_A_testIsEmpty
 	2. SetTester Line 136: Calls testIsEmpty() method
 	3. The bug was found in the add() method in ArraySet
 	4. I added a statement to update the rear variable when an element is added to the set.
 	5. I recognized the bug when the rear variable, which keeps track of the size of the set,
 		was not updating when an element was added.
 		
 Bug #3:
 	1. A_addB_AB_testRemoveA
 	2. SetTester Line 259: Calls testRemove() method
 	3. The bug was found in the remove() method in ArraySet
 	4. I changed the while statement in ArraySet.remove() method from 
 			"while (i < rear)" to
 			"while (i < rear - 1)"
 		so the array index would stay inbounds.
 	5. I recognized the bug when a ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException was thrown.
