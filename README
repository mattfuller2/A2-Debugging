OVERVIEW:

 GridMonitor builds a system to monitor array levels.
 GridMonitorTest confirms that GridMonitor meets all the requirements needed.


INCLUDED FILES:

 GridMonitor.java - source file
 GridMonitorInterface.java - source file
 GridMonitorTest.java - source file
 negatives.txt - source file
 oneByOne.txt - source file
 sample.txt - source file
 sample4x5.txt - source file
 sampleDoubles.txt - source file
 wideRange.txt - source file
 README - this file


BUILDING AND RUNNING:

 From the directory containing all source files, compile the test
 class (and all dependent classes) with the command:
 $ javac GridMonitorTest.java

 Run the compiled SetTester class with the command:
 $ java GridMonitorTest

 Console output will report which tests GridMonitor passed or failed.
 

PROGRAM DESIGN:

 GridMonitor implements the GridMonitorInterface interface. GridMonitor opens
 and reads the specified plain-text file containing current grid levels using 
 one or more Scanners. The Scanner class will throw a FileNotFoundException 
 if the given file name is not valid or the file cannot be read.

 GridMonitorTest confirms correct operation of all GridMonitorInterface methods 
 for change scenarios. It is configured to use the GridMonitor implementation of
 GridMonitorInterface.
 

TESTING:

 GridMonitorTest was the primary mechanism for testing GridMonitor. GridMonitorTest was
 written before GridMonitor, so test-driven development helped ensure that
 all GridMonitor functionality was being tested from the start.

 Scenarios being tested by SetTester include:
   loadSampleTest
   getBaseGridSampleTest
   getSurroundingSumGridSampleTest
   getSurroundingAvgGridSampleTest
   getDeltaGridSampleTest
   getDangerGridSampleTest
   lameToStringTest
   load4x5Test
   getBaseGrid4x5Test
   getSurroundingSumGrid4x5Test
   getSurroundingAvgGrid4x5Test
   getDeltaGrid4x5Test
   getDangerGrid4x5Test
   lameToString4x5Test
   loadDoublesTest
   getBaseGridDoublesTest
   getSurroundingSumGridDoublesTest
   loadNegativesTest
   getBaseGridNegativesTest
   getSurroundingSumGridNegativesTest
   getSurroundingAvgGridNegativesTest
   getDeltaGridNegativesTest
   getDangerGridNegativesTest
   load1x1Test
   getSurroundingSumGrid1x1Test
   loadWideRangeTest
   getBaseGridWideRangeTest
   getBaseGridEncapsulationTest
   getSurroundingSumGridEncapsulationTest
   getSurroundingAvgGridEncapsulationTest
   getDangerGridEncapsulationTest
   noSuchFileTest
 
DISCUSSION:
 
 I ran into problems trying to print out the toString methods from the GridMonitorTest. 
 It came back as an error because the returned value started with the method's name.
